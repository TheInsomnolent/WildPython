## Why do we use Python?
There are many shortcomings, but

- It's simple enough...
- It's quick enough...
- It's robust enough...
- It's universal enough...

for pretty much anything.

# Easy mode
## Pip installable git repo
- Proper module structure
- `setup.py` file

---

# One more step 
## Source distribution (sdist)
- Easily sharable tarball / zip
- Still retains raw source code
- PyPI hostable

---

# Wheels in wheels in wheels
## Built distribution (bdist)
- No end-user building required
    - No shipping devtools to users
- Runtime / version specific builds
    - Manage package dependencies with C-Extensions
    - Great for Tox
- `Universal wheels` for pythony python.

---

# Sharing is caring
## Publish to PyPI

Make sure to bump that version number!

```bash
$ pip install twine
$ twine upload dist/*
```

GOTCHA: Old versions of pip will point to wrong PyPI. 

Join the Pip10+ life!
